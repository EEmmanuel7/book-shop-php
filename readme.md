Book Shop
=========

A simple book shop application used for the Stripe Payments for PHP course.

Out of the box, this provides a basket system that allows you to add books. As part of the course, we will create the checkout and payment processing pages. If you are looking for the completed code, you can find it in the `examples/` directory.

To get started:

    composer install
    symfony server:start
